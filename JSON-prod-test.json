the PMs performance \n \nExpected skills\nHard skills: \n- Proven product management experience: you can demonstrate a
significant experience in product area (8+ years ideally) and you have a strong track record of achievements both on\n-
Delivery: you structured product organization, made teams grow, improved delivery process\n- Strategy and discovery: you
have success stories backed by hard data where your product initiatives created a significant business difference\n
\nProject management : you can anticipate potential risks (technical, operational, legal or business), you always are
one step ahead of current advancement, you are able to zoom in to solve operational problems as well as to zoom out to
present a clear strategic roadmap. You always fight complexity\n \nCommunication : be it written or oral, you are able
to express clearly technical or business problems. You have a strong synthesis capacity. You are able to adapt your
communication to the person you are talking to. Empathy is one of your strength, and you are able to calm down
discussions when people disagree.\n \nManagement and leadership : you proved to be a leader even on a small team, you
are able to get the most of your colleagues and make them grow. \n \nE-commerce expertise: you have worked in an
e-commerce environment and you know well the basics (catalog management, search, logistics, payments…), you are familiar
with marketplace concepts (supply, demand, network effect…). \n \nSoft skills: \nAgility, Speed and Entrepreneurial fire
: experience in strong growth environment where company changes every 6 months, ability to pivot quickly or take
decision with only 80% of the information\n \nData driven : not only can you perform basic data analysis through tools
like Amplitude or basic queries via SQL but your mind is data biased. Every project you launch start with KPI definition
and target. You see data as a strategic asset for the company and you try to maximize it in every project you start (eg
